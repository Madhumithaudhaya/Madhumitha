I used Python for all the 4 problems.

I just wrote each program separately and named them like they asked:

Problem-1.py

Problem-2.py

Problem-3.py

Problem-4.py

Problem-1 → small calculator using a class

Problem-2 → prints odd numbers till count = a

Problem-3 → prints odd numbers up to the biggest odd based on a

Problem-4 → counts how many numbers in the list are divisible by 1 to 9

How to run

python Problem-1.py
python Problem-2.py
python Problem-3.py
python Problem-4.py
